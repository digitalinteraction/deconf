	xplores learning in Participatory Design (PD). We invite the PD community 
	to reflect on the multiple ways learning can strengthen and expand how we 
	frame and drive participatory design to reflect on how we can expand learn
	ing in PD to gain an understanding for the complex system we are all part 
	of\, for the interdependence of social\, ecological and economic systems. 
	Through this workshop\, we will invite participants to address questions s
	uch as: What theories and concepts can be used to understand learning in P
	D? What kind of approaches are used to foster learning in PD? How is learn
	ing evaluated in PD? The workshop will bring together members of the PD co
	mmunity interested in these questions\, and serve as the basis for develop
	ing ongoing and new collaborations around the topic of learning in PD.\n\n
	\nThis workshop runs over two half days with some activity taking place at
	 the [Nordic PDCPlace](/085ef3a7eb14469189e9f182a6602958) on 26th Septembe
	r 12:00 pm to 3:00 pm UTC. [Please check the workshop website for further 
	details.](https://learninginpd.wixsite.com/workshop)\n\n\n\n

	talk briefly sketches out some thoughts on the possibility of a design pra
	ctice that has the capacity to comprehend the contradictions of an incredi
	bly and irreducibly complex and interconnected world. I propose that throu
	gh an understanding of culture as that which emerges through relations\, w
	hich are themselves constituted through scalar movements between concepts\
	, subjects etc.\, rather than as something essential - an understanding of
	 culture as emerging from ‘dialogues of difference’ - is a fruitful way wi
	th which to begin to think participation and the forging of both local and
	 global solidarities in modern\, cosmopolitan societies. \n\n\nThe longer 
	version of the keynote can be [accessed via the link](https://docs.google.

	ersity at the Integrated Digital Media program in the department of Techno
	logy\, Culture & Society\, where he teaches courses in interaction and sys
	temic design\, design research\, and design studies\, and directs the PhD 
	program in Human-Centered Design\, Technology and Innovation. His interest
	s intersect between critical design studies and history\, postcolonial and
	 decolonial theory\, and the philosophy and history of design and technolo
	gy with an area focus on the Indian subcontinent. He is a founder of the D
	ecolonising Design platform and the Architectural Design Research Lab in K
	arachi\, and also does academic consulting focusing on curriculum developm
	ent at the undergraduate level\, having designed curricula for design prog
	rams at the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture (IVSAA) and Habib 
	University (HU) in Karachi. More recently\, he has been working on an [NEH
	 grant](https://nyuhumanities.org/program/inverting-the-wunderkammer/) tha
	t brings together perspectives from the natural sciences\, humanities\, an
	d design on the smallest of things\, moss\, in order to rethink how we mig
	ht redesign public digital humanities archives. Dr. Ansari received his Ph
	D in Design Studies and MDes in Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellon Un
	iversity\, and his BDes in Communication Design from IVSAA.\n\n\n\n
